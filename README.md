# Analysis of a dataset with iris species

The aim of the project was to perform an exploratory analysis of a dataset containing three species of irises (_setosa_, _virginica_ and _versicolor_) and to develop a classification model. The final result in the form of a classifier was made available through the [REST API service](https://github.com/kadyb/model-REST-API).

The project includes:
1. Code.Rmd - R Notebook source code (Kod.Rmd - Polish version)
2. [Report.html](https://kadyb.github.io/irises-analysis/Report.html) ([Raport.html](https://kadyb.github.io/irises-analysis/Report.html) - Polish version)
3. model_LDA.rds - classification model developed using the `caret` library
